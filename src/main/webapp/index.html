    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>To achieve a bachelors degree students have to reach at least 180 credits. Normally a basis class has 3 credits,
            a project class has 6 credits, a context class has 2 credits and the bachelors project has 12.
            To see how many credits have been achieved, the fhnw provides a ToR (Transcript of Records) where the student can
            see how many credits he/she has.</p>
        <p>On every failed class, the student gets the amount of credits of the class as minues credits which sums up with
            every failed class. E.g. failing in two classes which have 3 credits, the minus credits would be 6 and so on.</p>

        <p>Minus credits are not listed in the ToR and the student is responsible for having an eye on them. However, the
            minus credits can be requested from the fhnw administration but to always request these is demanding.</p>

        <p>The structure of the classes and groups are like following: Each class has a name, how many credits can be
            achieved, a fail count and an indicator if the class is done or not. Each class belongs to a class group.
            A class group has a minimum limit which have to be achieved in order to pass the group. During the study the
            studen has to pass the given groups.</p>

        <p>In this project the student can create class groups and classes. Afterwards assign the classes to the class
            groups. The highlight is the overview of the classes and groups showing the student which classes have been
            still are open, which are passed, which classes have fail counts equal to one and which classes have fail count
            equals to two. According to fhnw rules, each class can be repeated one time. If a class has fail count equals to
            two, this class gets banned and can not be visited anymore.</p>

        <p>The student is responsible for entering correct data into the application. The application does not verify if the
            entered classes and groups actually exists or not.</p>
